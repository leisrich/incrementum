## Academic Research Workflow

This workflow helps researchers extract and retain key information from scientific papers.

### Setup

1. **Create a structured category system**:
   - Create main categories for different research areas
   - Add subcategories for specific topics, methodologies, or authors
   
2. **Configure tags for your field**:
   - Method tags: "qualitative", "quantitative", "mixed-methods"
   - Quality tags: "important", "groundbreaking", "needs-verification"
   - Status tags: "to-read", "in-progress", "processed", "referenced"

### Daily Workflow

1. **Import new papers (10-15 minutes)**:
   - Import PDFs from your reference manager
   - Categorize papers appropriately
   - Add initial tags based on abstract
   
2. **Incremental reading (30-60 minutes)**:
   - Continue reading papers marked "in-progress"
   - Highlight key passages (methods, results, limitations)
   - Create extracts for important information
   - Update tags based on content

3. **Extract processing (15-30 minutes)**:
   - Process 5-10 pending extracts
   - Set appropriate priority levels (higher for core concepts)
   - Generate learning items (focus on research questions, methods, key findings)
   - Add specific tags to related extracts

4. **Review session (15-20 minutes)**:
   - Complete daily review of due learning items
   - Rate your recall honestly
   - Focus on connecting different research findings

5. **Knowledge synthesis (weekly, 30-60 minutes)**:
   - Use the knowledge network visualization to find connections
   - Create new extracts that synthesize related findings
   - Generate higher-level learning items that connect concepts

### Example: Studying Machine Learning Research Papers

**Step 1: Paper Import and Initial Reading**

Import the paper "Attention Is All You Need" and categorize it under "Computer Science > Machine Learning > Transformers".

During initial reading, create extracts for:
- Abstract and key contributions
- Architecture description
- Training methodology
- Results and benchmarks
- Limitations and future work

Tag the paper with "nlp", "transformer", "attention-mechanism", "important".

**Step 2: Extract Processing**

For the "Architecture description" extract:

1. Create learning items:
   - Q: "What are the key components of the Transformer architecture?"
   - A: "The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder and decoder, each composed of stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers."

   - Q: "How does multi-head attention work in Transformers?"
   - A: "Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces. It projects queries, keys, and values h times with different learned linear projections, performs attention in parallel, and concatenates the results."

2. Set high priority (80) for foundational concepts.

**Step 3: Regular Review**

Schedule reviews following the spaced repetition algorithm. As you encounter more related papers, you'll reinforce and connect concepts across the literature.

**Step 4: Knowledge Integration**

After studying several papers on transformers:
1. Use the network visualization to see connections between concepts
2. Create a new synthetic extract that compares different transformer variants
3. Generate learning items that test your understanding of the evolution of the architecture

  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  };
}, [dataSource]);
```

Add explanation:
- The cleanup function prevents memory leaks
- It runs before the component unmounts
- It also runs before each re-execution of the effect

## Adopting These Workflows

When adopting these workflows for your own use:

1. **Start small**: Begin with one workflow and a limited number of documents
2. **Customize**: Adapt the workflows to your specific needs and schedule
3. **Be consistent**: Regular, shorter sessions are better than infrequent long ones
4. **Iterate**: Refine your approach based on what works best for you
5. **Track progress**: Use the statistics dashboard to monitor your retention

Remember that incremental learning is a skill that improves with practice. As you become more familiar with Incrementum, you'll develop your own optimal workflows tailored to your learning style and goals.
