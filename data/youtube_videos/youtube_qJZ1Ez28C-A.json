one single path.\nBut in this video, I will prove to you\nthat this is not the case.\nEverything is actually exploring\nall possible paths all at once.\nSo let's start with a simple thought\nexperiment.\nSay you're at a beach when all of a sudden\nyou see your friend\nstruggling out in the water.\nYou want to go help them\nas quickly as possible.\nSo which path\nshould you take to get there?\nThe shortest path is a straight line,\nso you could head directly towards him.\nBut you can run faster than you can swim,\nand this path requires more swimming.\nSo alternatively,\nyou could run down the beach\nto minimize the\ndistance through the water.\nBut now\nthe total\ndistance is longer than it needs to be.\nSo the optimal path,\nit turns out, is somewhere in between.\nTo be precise, it depends on the speeds\nat which you can run and swim.\nNow, you might recognize this\nmathematical relationship because it is\nthe exact same law that governs light\npassing from one medium into another.\nSo light also takes the fastest\npath from point A to point B.\nWhat's weird about this is that as humans,\nwe can see where we want to go\nand then figure out the fastest route.\nBut light, I mean, how does light know\nhow to travel\nto minimize its journey time?\nNow here is where\nmy misconception comes in.\nI shine a laser beam.\nThe light just goes in one direction.\nI throw a ball.\nThe ball just goes in one direction,\nyou know?\nI would have answered,\nthere is nothing strange about this.\nLight sets off from point A\nin some direction.\nAnd then a little while later\nit encounters a new medium.\nAnd due to local interactions\nwith that medium,\nit changes direction,\nending up at point B.\nIf you later find that of all the possible\npaths, light took the shortest time\nto get from A to B, I wouldn't\nthink it was optimizing for anything.\nI would just think that's what happens\nwhen light obeys local rules.\nBut now I will prove to you that light\ndoesn't set out in only one direction.\nInstead, it really does explore all possible paths.\nAnd the same is true for electrons\nand protons.\nAll quantum particles.\nSo the fact that we see things on single,\nwell-defined trajectories\nis, in a way, the most convincing illusion\nnature has ever devised.\nAnd the way it works all comes down to a\nquantity known as the action.\nIn a previous video, we showed\nhow an obscure scientist, Maupertuis,\nmade an ad hoc proposal\nthat there should be a quantity\ncalled action, which he defined\nas mass times velocity times distance.\nAnd he claimed that everything\nalways follows the path that minimizes\nthe action.\nHamilton later showed that this action\nis equivalent to the integral\nover time of kinetic energy\nminus potential energy.\nAction was useful and an alternative way\nof solving physics problems,\nespecially when Newton's laws\nget too cumbersome.\nBut then, around the turn of the 20th\ncentury, action showed up at the heart\nof a scientific revolution:\nthe birth of quantum mechanics.\nIt all started with electric\nlighting in Germany.\nThink about what it's like in the 1890s,\nright?\nElectricity being more widely available,\nat least in urban sectors.\nAnd things like, you know, light bulbs.\nThey were new.\nThey were literally the hot new thing.\nGermany wanted to replace all their gas\nstreet lights with electric light bulbs.\nSo an important question was\nhow do you maximize\nthe visible light\ngiven off by a hot filament?\nScientists at a German research\ninstitute, the PTR, studied\nhow much light different materials\nemitted as a function of temperature.\nAt low temperatures, each material\ngave off its own characteristic spectrum,\nmostly in the infrared,\nbut above about 500\u00b0C\nall materials started to glow\nin the same way,\nwith an almost identical\ndistribution of light.\nThe hotter the object,\nthe more energy was emitted\nat every wavelength, and the peak\nof the distribution shifted to the left.\nBut they still didn't understand\nhow it worked theoretically.\nSo that was sort of the next step, right?\nIf you can understand how it works\ntheoretically,\nthen you can use that theory\nto potentially design your products.\nThey started by imagining\nthe simplest object possible,\none that would absorb all light\nthat falls onto it\nand perfectly emit radiation\nbased on its temperature.\nThey came up with a hole in a metal cube.\nThis hole is a perfect blackbody\nbecause any light that shines onto\nit will go straight in, bounce\naround inside, and eventually be absorbed.\nBut this also makes it a perfect emitter.\nAny radiation inside the cube can escape\nthrough the hole unimpeded.\nTheorists reasoned that electrons\nin the walls of the cube\nwould wiggle around,\nemitting electromagnetic waves.\nThese waves\nwould then bounce off the other walls.\nWhen you have two waves\nof the same frequency,\nwhere one travels to the right\nand the other to the left,\nthey can interfere in such a way\nthat they create places\nwhere there's no wave amplitude\nthose are nodes, and places where there is\nmaximum wave amplitude,\nthe anti nodes. Waves like this are called\nstanding waves\nbecause they don't really move left\nor right\nand inside a cavity,\ngiven enough time and reflections.\nIt is only these standing waves\nthat survive.\nAll the other ones just cancel out.\nSo a sort of order emerges from the chaos.\nIn two dimensions, standing waves\nlook something like this.\nFor shorter wavelengths\nor higher frequencies, you can fit more\nand more different vibrational modes.\nInside this cube,\nso that in three\ndimensions, the total number of modes\nis proportional to frequency cubed,\nor one over lambda cubed.\nThe expectation was\nthere would be more and more waves\ninside the cube,\nthe shorter the wavelength.\nThis led directly to the Rayleigh-Jeans law.\nAt longer wavelengths.\nIt matched the experimental data\npretty well,\nbut at shorter wavelengths\nthe theory diverged from experiment.\nIn fact, it predicted\nthat at the shortest wavelengths,\nan infinite amount of energy\nwould be emitted.\nThis, for obvious reasons, became known\nas the ultraviolet catastrophe.\nThe person to solve\nthis problem was Max Planck,\nbut Planck almost didn't\nmake it into studying physics,\nbecause when he was 16 years old,\nhe went up to his professor and asked him,\nwell,\nmaybe I could do a career in physics.\nTo which his professor responded\nthat he'd better find another field\nto do research in, because physics\nwas essentially a complete science.\nYou know, there was just a few tiny\nlittle problems that they had to clean up.\nBut besides that, it was over.\nBut Planck didn't listen.\nBy 1897, he was a professor himself,\nand for the next three years he struggled\nto find a theoretical explanation\nfor blackbody radiation.\nHe tried approach after approach,\nbut no matter what, he tried.\nNothing worked.\nHe said I was ready to sacrifice\nevery one of my previous convictions\nabout physical laws.\nThen, in a quote \u2018act of desperation\u2019,\nhe did something\nno one had thought to try.\nAccording to classical physics,\nthe energy of an electromagnetic wave\ndepends only on its amplitude,\nnot its wavelength or frequency.\nAnd it could take any arbitrary value.\nSo any atom could emit\nany wavelength of light\nwith an arbitrarily\nsmall amount of energy.\nBut Planck tried restricting the energy\nso that it could only come in multiples\nof a smallest amount.\nA quantum.\nAnd he made the energy of\none quantum\ndirectly proportional to its frequency.\nE equals hf, where h is just a constant.\nThink about what this does\nto the radiation coming from the blackbody\nat a given temperature.\nThe atoms in the cavity\nhave a range of energies.\nSome have a little bit.\nA few have a lot, and most of their energy\nsomewhere in between.\nFor long wavelength\nlow frequency radiation, the energy\nHF of one quantum is small,\nso all of the atoms have enough energy\nto emit this wavelength,\nand the spectrum matches\nthe really gene's prediction very well.\nBut at shorter\nwavelengths, higher frequencies,\nthe energy of a quantum increases.\nAnd now not all of the atoms have\nenough energy to emit that wavelength.\nThis is why experiment diverges\nfrom the classical prediction.\nThe spectrum peaks\nand then starts to fall because fewer\nand fewer atoms have enough energy\nto emit one quantum of that radiation.\nAnd there comes a point\nwhen none of the atoms have enough energy\nto emit one quantum.\nSo here the spectrum must drop to zero.\nWith this approach, Planck got a new formula\nfor the radiation spectrum.\nNow all that was left for him to do\nwas to tune the parameter h.\nAnd when he did this just right,\nhe got his formula to match up\nperfectly with experiment.\nBut he was sort of troubled\nby his own formula because to him\nit was just a mathematical trick.\nHe had no clue why it worked.\nIt was purely formal.\nAnd most importantly,\nhe had no clue what this H represented.\nI mean, he had introduced a new\nphysical constant without any reason.\nHe wrote a theoretical interpretation\nhad to be found at any cost,\nno matter how high.\nSo from that moment\non, he dedicated himself to finding one.\nHe later reflected that after some weeks\nof the most strenuous work of my life,\nlight came into the darkness\nand a new undreamed of perspective\nopened up before me.\nHe introduces\nwhat we now call Planck's constant,\nand it has the units of action. Planck's\nconstant, h\nis a quantum of action.\nPlanck later proposed that any time\nany change happened in nature,\nit would be some whole multiple\nof this quantum of action.\nSo it's kind of spooky, this breakthrough\nthat starts the ball rolling toward\nquantum theory brings action in not energy\nand not force. Action. Gives you a hint.\nAt first, the quantum of action\ngot little attention.\nThat is, until a 26 year old patent clerk\ncame on the scene.\nIn 1905, Albert\nEinstein claimed that Planck's theory\nwasn't just a mathematical trick.\nIt was telling us\nthat light actually comes in discrete\npackets,\nor photons, each with an energy HF.\nEinstein used this insight\nto explain the photoelectric effect\nhow light can eject electrons from metal,\nbut only when\nthe frequency is high enough.\nIf the frequency is too low,\nno electrons will be emitted\nregardless of the intensity.\nThe idea of quantization spread.\nEight years later,\nNiels Bohr was trying to understand\nhow an atom is stable\nif it has a positive charge in the center\nand negative electrons whizzing around it.\nWhy don't they just spiral\ninto the nucleus, radiating their energy\nas they go?\nAnd what he wants to do is,\nhe says there's something fishy\nabout something being discrete\nthat seems to be the new ambiguous weirdo\nlesson of the new quantum of action. Bohr\nrealizes that as the electron\ngoes around the nucleus,\nit has an angular momentum.\nMass times velocity times radius.\nSo angular momentum\nhas the same units as action.\nAnd so what he decides to do is discretize\nthe orbital angular momentum.\nFor no good reason\nhe says, let me slap that on and say,\nand imagine the electron can only be in\none unit, two units,\nthree units of the same quantity H.\nAnd because it's talking about motion\nin a circle, the factors two pi come in.\nSo is really nh over two pi,\nwhat we now call an h bar.\nThis comes out of nowhere.\nThere seems like\nabsolutely no good reason why\nangular momentum should be quantized.\nBut by doing it, Bohr finds the correct\nenergy levels of the hydrogen atom.\nWhen an electron jumps from a higher orbit\nto a lower one, the energy difference\nis given off as a photon\nof a particular color of light.\nExactly reproducing the hydrogen spectrum.\nAnd that was a pretty startling thing\nto have fall out.\nI think that really was compelling.\nTake some quantity with the unit of action\nand apply some, again, kind of ad hoc,\ndiscretization or quantization to it.\nNow, although it worked\nspectacularly well,\nno one can make sense of it.\nThat is until 11 years later.\nFor his PhD,\nLouis de Broglie was contemplating\nthe recent discoveries in physics.\nAnd his big insight was that if light\ncould be both a wave and a particle,\nthen maybe matter\nparticles could also be waves.\nHe proposed that everything.\nElectrons, basketballs, people,\nabsolutely everything has a wavelength.\nAnd he defined this wavelength\nanalogously to light as Planck's\nconstant,\ndivided by the particles momentum or\nmass times velocity.\nNow, if an electron is a wave,\nthe only way it could stay bound\nto a nucleus in an atom is\nif it exists as a standing wave.\nThat requires\nthat a whole number of wavelengths\nfit around the circumference of the orbit.\nYou could have one wavelength\nor two wavelengths or three, and so on.\nSo the circumference two pi\nr must be equal\nto some multiple n times the wavelength.\nWe can sub in de Broglies expression\nfor the wavelength to get the two pi\nr equals NH over mv,\nbut we can rearrange this to get the mvr.\nThe angular momentum\nis equal to NH over two pi.\nThat is\nprecisely Bohr's quantized\nangular momentum condition.\nBut now we have a good physical reason\nwhy it's quantized.\nBecause electrons are waves\nand they must exist as standing\nwaves to be bound in atoms\nbecause they want to have constructive\ninterference, have a stable orbit back.\nThat's pretty good.\nYou get a dissertation out of that.\nThat's pretty good.\nIt is this wave nature of quantum objects.\nThat means they no longer\nhave a single path through space.\nInstead,\nthey must explore all possible paths.\nNow, I have thought about\nand taught the double slit experiment\nhundreds of times\nwithout fully realizing this implication.\nIn the double slit experiment.\nI feel like the mental thing\nthat I'm doing in my head is like, okay,\nwell, the beam is not perfectly straight,\nand of course it's going to intersect\nboth of those slits because they're really\nclose together. You know?\nBut then\nI heard this story about a professor\nteaching the double slit experiment,\nand it makes everything so clear.\nSo the professor starts by explaining\nthe setup.\nElectrons are fired one at a time\nthrough two slits\nto be detected at a screen.\nNow, because you can't say for certain\nwhich slit the particle went through,\nquantum mechanics tells us\nit must go through both at the same time.\nSo to get the probability of finding\na particle somewhere on the screen,\nyou simply add up\nthe amplitude of the wave\ngoing through one slit, with the amplitude\nof the wave going through the other slit\nand square it.\nBut that's when a student raised his hand.\nWhat if you add a third slit?\nWell, you just add up the amplitudes\nof the waves\ngoing through each of the three slits,\nand you can work out the probability.\nThe professor wanted to\ncontinue,\nbut then the student interjected again.\nWhat if you add a fourth slit and a fifth?\nThe professor, who is now clearly losing\nhis patience, replies, I think it's clear\nto the whole class that you just add up\nthe amplitudes from all the slits.\nIt's the same for six, seven, etc.\nbut now the bold student\npressed his advantage.\nWhat if I make it infinite slits\nso that the screen disappears?\nAnd then I add a second screen\nwith infinite slits\nand a third and a fourth.\nThe student's point was clear.\nEven when we're not doing\na double slit experiment,\nwhen it's just light or particles\ntraveling through empty space,\nthey must be exploring all possible paths.\nBecause this is exactly how the math\nwould work if you had infinite screens,\neach with infinite slits.\nYou have to add up the amplitude\nfrom each slit.\nThat's just the way it works.\nAccording to the story,\nthe student was Richard Feynman,\nand while the story is made\nup, the logic is flawless.\nBecause if you believe\nin the double slit experiment\nthat you can't tell which of the two slits\nthe particle went through,\nthen you have to consider the possibility\nthat it goes through both.\nBy that same logic, any time\nany particle goes from place\none to place two.\nYou have to consider\nall the possible paths\nit could take to get there, including ones\nthat go faster than the speed of light,\nincluding ones that go back in time,\nand including ones that go\nto the other side of the moon and back.\nI feel like I can't go to the sun\nand back.\nYou have to restrict it\nto be local, right?\nSo the math doesn't do that.\nI mean, you could see that\njust in the double slit experiment, right?\nAnd we'll do light because then there's\nno funky business with the speed.\nIf you're going to say like,\nthis path interferes with this\npath and these distances\nare different, right.\nAnd so clearly\nthey can\u2019t have the same speed.\nSo you need to consider\npaths that have different speeds.\nFeynman's way of doing quantum mechanics\nsuggests that anything going from\none place to another is connected\nin every possible way.\nAnd the internet is kind of like that too\nconnecting us to anything,\nanywhere, at any time.\nAt least in theory,\nthere are still artificial barriers\nlike geo blocks and country restrictions\nthat block off parts of the internet.\nBut fortunately, there's today's sponsor,\nNordVPN, which can help knock down\nthose barriers.\nJust connect to one of their thousands of\nservers, for example, this one in the US.\nAnd it looks as if you're accessing\nthe internet from there.\nThe team and I \ntravel a lot to make these videos,\nand using a

now let's get back to Feynman's crazy\nway of doing quantum mechanics.\nSo according to Feynman,\nany time a particle, a photon, or even a\nmacroscopic object moves from point 1 to point 2,\nit has some chance to take any path.\nAnd as preposterous as it might sound.\nHe found that we need to include\nall these paths in our calculation,\nwhere each path is weighted the same.\nSo why\nthen, do we not see all those crazy paths?\nWell, that's because we still need\nto add up their amplitudes.\nFor simplicity,\nimagine we only have three paths.\nThen here's what we're going to do.\nFirst, let's take this one.\nWhen the particle wave starts\nfollowing it, we start a stopwatch.\nIt goes around and around very fast,\nand when it gets to the end point,\nwe hit stop.\nWe'll do the same for the other two paths.\nAnd then we add up\nthe arrows, square the result.\nAnd that is\nthen proportional to the probability\nthe particle took those paths\nto get there.\nIn this case\nthe arrow and square are pretty small, so\nthe probability of the particle going from\n1 to 2 using these paths is small.\nCompare that with these three paths.\nFor example.\nWell now the arrow is much larger.\nAnd this is important.\nThe larger the resulting arrow, the higher\nthe probability of that event happening.\nNow in these examples the stopwatch is not\nactually measuring time.\nInstead it measures\nsomething called the phase.\nJust as in the double slit experiment,\nwhen a wave takes a different path\nfrom point 1 to 2, it will end up there\nwith a different phase.\nAnd this phase is what determines\nthe amplitude of the wave at that point.\nMathematically, we can write the amplitude\nour stopwatch as e to the I phi,\nwhere phi is the phase.\nAs the particle wave follows a path,\nits phase increases.\nWinding the vector around.\nSo now the big question is how much\ndoes the phase change for each path?\nWell, to answer that, imagine\nwe split up the path into many tiny\nsections, each one\nso small that it's effectively straight.\nThen in each\nsection, the particle wave goes\na distance delta x and a time delta t,\nand the increase in phase\nis easy to compute.\nIt just depends on the wavelength\nand frequency of the wave.\nTo find the total increase in phase\nfor the whole path,\nwe just add up all the little phase\nincreases of all the individual sections.\nBut we can sub in lambda equals\nh over mv from de Broglie,\nand using e we can sub in for frequency.\nWe can also simplify by writing h over two\npi as h bar.\nTo get this expression.\nThen we can take delta t to the right.\nAnd if we make delta\nt infinitesimally small,\nthen we can replace this\nsum with an integral.\nBut now Dx by Dt is just velocity.\nSo we can write this as m b squared.\nNow we know that in the simplest case\nthe total energy\ne is just kinetic plus potential energy.\nAnd subbing that in we're left\nwith the integral\nover time of kinetic energy\nminus potential energy.\nBut wait a second.\nThat is just the classical action.\nSo it's action that determines\nhow fast the stopwatch turns.\nAs the particle moves along a trajectory,\nits action increases,\nand that is what increases the phase.\nAnd what's important to note is that h\nbar is tiny.\nIt's about ten to the -34 joule seconds,\nwhich is way\nsmaller than the action\nof any everyday object.\nThat means the phase of ordinary objects\non ordinary paths\nspins around zillions of times,\neventually pointing\nin some random direction.\nIf you consider a slightly different path,\nthe action may be slightly different\nsay 0.01 joule seconds different.\nThat doesn't seem like much,\nbut divide it by h bar\nand the arrow will spin around\nten to the 32 more times.\nSo again, it will just point\nin some random direction.\nThis is what\nhappens\nto almost all of the possible paths.\nSo when you add up the phases,\nthey just cancel out.\nThey destructively interfere.\nThe only exception is for the paths\nclosest\nto the path of least action,\nbecause these paths are at a minimum.\nSo if you make tiny changes to the path\nto first order,\nthe action doesn't change.\nAnd so for other paths that are very close\nto the path of least action,\ntheir arrows point\nin basically the same direction.\nThey constructively interfere.\nAnd that is why those are the paths\nwe see.\nThis explains how light knows where to go.\nI mean, it doesn't.\nIt just explores all possible paths,\nbut the past we end up seeing are the ones\nthat interfere constructively.\nAnd those are the paths of least action.\nSo really,\nthis is how classical mechanics emerges\nfrom quantum mechanics.\nIt's why a ball follows the trajectory\nit does, and how planets orbit the sun.\nThey don't really have a precise\ntrajectory.\nInstead, everything explores\nall possible paths.\nIt's just that massive particles\nhave large actions compared to hbar,\nso that only paths extremely close\nto the true path of least action survive.\nWhich is why they're much more particle\nlike.\nIf you go to much smaller particles\nlike electrons or photons,\nthe actions are much smaller,\nand so there's more of a spread\nin which trajectories\nthey actually end up taking.\nNow, you might say,\nI still don't believe you,\nbut Casper has this incredible demo\nthat should convince you 100%\nthat this is really how the world works.\nTo do it, I've taken a light,\na mirror and a camera.\nNow there are infinitely many paths\nthat the light could take.\nAnd according to Feynman,\nwe have to add the contributions of each them.\nIncluding paths that go like this.\nNow, you might say he's crazy.\nI'm not crazy. That's what happens.\nAnother possibility is I could come here\nand go.\nOr it could come here and go.\nOr it could come\nwhere you'd like it to come and go.\nAnd it can go over here\nand go and so on and so on.\nAnd these are all possibilities.\nAnd every single one of these paths\nhas their own little arrow.\nSo what we can do is we can look at all\nthose arrows and see where they line up.\nAnd so if I turn on this light,\nthat's exactly where you see it reflects\nthat at the angle of incidence\nis equal to the angle of reflection.\nBut now what I'm going to do\nis I'm going to cover up that spot\nso that we no longer\nsee the light reflect.\nAnd then I'm going to prove\nthat really Feynman is right.\nThat really light\nalso goes like this.\nIt's just that most of the time,\nthose effects are cancelled out.\nNow that sounds impossible, right?\nBut let's zoom in to this tiny piece\nright here.\nThen we see all these different paths\nand all the arrows just go around\nand around in circles.\nSo when you add them up,\nthey all just cancel out.\nBut what if I cover up about half of them\nlike so.\nWell, now when I add up those arrows you\nsuddenly do see a large resulting arrow.\nAnd so if I can somehow cover up\nthis mirror in many, many tiny strips,\nthen I should be able to get the light\nto reflect like this.\nAnd I can do that with this piece of foil\nright here on this piece of foil.\nThere are about a thousand lines\nper millimeter, and that should be enough\nto get this effect.\nSo let me turn off the lights.\nSo let's see\nI'm going to turn it on in 321.\nWe see it.\nThat is so cool.\nIt actually looks a lot weirder\nthan I was expecting it to.\nI was expecting more like, one spot,\nbut there's many, many spots\nwhere it's reflecting.\nOh, okay. Okay.\nAnd just to show,\nI haven't been cheating you, right\nunderneath is my finger.\nAnd even with the light\non, you know, we see the light reflect.\nAnd if we remove the cover,\nthen what do we see?\nYeah, we see exactly the normal reflection\nwhere it's always supposed to go,\nwhich is right there.\nAnd then we've got\nnow all these extra reflections,\nall these extra bits\nwhere the pattern just lines up.\nSo very, very cool.\nWhen I was talking about this\nwith a friend, actually,\nhe said, yeah,\nbut you're using a diffraction grating.\nThat's kind of like cheating.\nYou get all these other reflections\nright now\nand this light is just\ngoing in all directions.\nAnd so there's one other thing.\nI've been super, super curious to try.\nI also want to do this with a laser\nwhere I shine the laser right next to it.\nAnd then if light does take every possible\npath, we should also see it\ncome off here.\nIt probably shouldn't work.\nI actually have a laser right over here\nand we can see when I shine it.\nIt really does.\nJust go to one spot\nand you can see where that spot is.\nIt's right over there, which is about the\nsame place where we had our reflection.\nAnd you can also see right now if\nwe look at this view that you cannot see\nthe laser light at all.\nRight.\nLike I could see the laser, but I have to\nbring it out all the way over here.\nAnd then I'm able to sort of\nsee the light.\nBut if I just put it up here,\nyou can see the reflection.\nNow, what I'm going to do next\nis I'm going to put\nthis foil, this magic foil,\nand I'm going to put it over here\nand we can turn off this.\nAnd now let's see what happens\nwhen I turn on the laser.\nWait wait wait wait.\nNo way,\nno way.\nIt works.\nIt works. Wait. What?\nLook where the laser is going.\nOh, my God, it actually works.\nWhat? What?\nThis is definitely the coolest demo\nI've ever done.\nSo what I was doing is I was holding\nthe laser, and I can show you right now.\nI was shining it down, like, this way off.\nAnd you could still see it reflect.\nBut if I take this away, it disappears.\nAnd if I put this back, it appears\nso that it shows really that we cannot\nget rid of the area which gives zero\nthat it really is canceling out.\nAnd if we do clever things to it,\nwe can demonstrate the reality of the\nreflections from this part of the mirror.\nSo light and by extension,\neverything really does\nexplore all possible paths.\nIt's just that most of the time\nthe crazy paths destructively interfere.\nThat's because the actions of nearby paths\nchange rapidly.\nNow, I've studied physics\nfor most of my life,\nand I feel like I never really appreciated\nhow important action\nand the principle of least action are.\nBut now I think I finally get it.\nAnd I finally get why.\nIf you ask theoretical physicists\nwhat they're working\non, they'll rarely talk about energy\nor forces.\nMost of the time,\nthey'll talk about action.\nNobody in particle physics approaches\nparticle physics\nfrom a viewpoint other than least action.\nBut we teach physics historically,\nand no least action\nis almost like the new kid on the block\nfor understanding physics.\nAnd so, yeah, we build up to it.\nBut in reality,\nI think life's a lot easier once\nyou realize this underlying principle,\nbecause when you do,\nthen all you have to do is write down\nthe correct Lagrangian\nso you get the right action and out come\nthe laws of physics.\nSo you've got a separate Lagrangian\nfor classical mechanics,\nfor special relativity,\nfor electrodynamics, and so on.\nIt's a single mathematical framework\nthat, once you've learned it,\nthen you can apply it in different places\nin exactly the same way.\nThe hunt\nfor the theory of everything, right.\nThe thing that will encompass\nall of physics\nin reality, what people are asking is\nwhat is this Lagrangian\nthat can spit out all of the laws\nof physics in this universe?\nThat's really what they're asking.\nThe moment\nwe haven't really found that right.\nBecause we can\nwe can sticky tape things together,\nbut we don't know if that's the proper\nmathematical structure.\nSo that's what people are hunting for.\nThis was our second\nvideo on the principle of least action.\nAnd I know we've covered a lot,\nbut you might still have some questions.\nSo we are hosting a Q&A\nover on our Patreon.\nYou can submit your questions there,\nand we'll also post the Q&A there.\nAnd it's all for free.\nIf you want to submit a question\nor watch the Q&A.\nHead over to Patreon.com/Veritasium\nand you can make a free account.\nOr you can support us a little bit as well\nif you'd like.\nI'd also like to thank NordVPN\nfor sponsoring this video.\nCheck them out by clicking the link in\nthe description or scanning this QR code.\nAnd finally,\nI really want to thank you for watching."
