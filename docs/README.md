# Incrementum User Guide

## Introduction

Incrementum is an advanced incremental learning system designed to help you efficiently process and retain information. It combines document management, knowledge extraction, and spaced repetition techniques into a single integrated application.

This guide will walk you through setting up and using Incrementum to create your own personal knowledge base and optimize your learning.

The left panel shows your document categories and a list of documents. The main area contains tabs for documents, extracts, learning items, and other views.

## Importing Documents

### Importing a Local File

1. Click the **Import File** button in the toolbar or go to **File > Import File**
2. Select a supported file type (PDF, HTML, TXT, EPUB, DOCX)

### Importing from a URL

1. Click **File > Import from URL**
2. Enter the URL of the web page or online document
3. Click **OK** to import the content

After importing, the document will open in a new tab. PDF documents use the enhanced PDF viewer with highlighting and extraction capabilities.

## Extracting Knowledge

As you read through documents, you'll want to extract key information into your knowledge base:

### Creating Extracts from PDFs

1. Open a PDF document
2. Select text by dragging your mouse over content
3. Click the **Create Extract** button
4. The extract will be created and opened in a new tab

### Creating Extracts Manually

1. Go to **Edit > New Extract**
2. Select a source document
3. Enter the content in the editor
4. Set the priority (1-100) based on importance
5. Click **Save**

### Auto-Segmenting Documents

1. Open a document
2. Click the **Auto-Segment** button
3. The document will be analyzed and divided into logical segments as extracts
4. Review the generated extracts

## Creating Learning Items

Learning items are what you'll review with spaced repetition. They can be question-answer pairs or cloze deletions:

### Creating Items Manually

1. Open an extract
2. Click **Edit > New Learning Item** or use the extract's built-in item creator
3. Select the item type (Question-Answer or Cloze Deletion)
4. Enter the question and answer
5. Set the priority
6. Click **Save**

### Using AI-Assisted Generation

1. Open an extract
2. In the learning item editor, select "AI-assisted generation"
3. Choose the number of items to generate
4. Click **Generate Questions**
5. Review the suggestions and select ones to keep
6. Click **Save** or **Generate More**

## Reviewing with Spaced Repetition

Incrementum uses an advanced spaced repetition algorithm (based on SM-18) to optimize review timing:

### Starting a Review Session

1. Click the **Start Review Session** button or go to **Learning > Start Review Session**
2. You'll see your current due items
3. Rate your recall from 0-5:
   - 0: Complete blackout
   - 1: Incorrect response, but familiar
   - 2: Incorrect response, but easy recall
   - 3: Correct, but difficult
   - 4: Correct, after some hesitation
   - 5: Perfect recall
4. The algorithm will schedule the next review based on your performance

### Understanding the Review Schedule

- Items you know well will appear less frequently
- Difficult items will appear more often
- The system adapts to your learning curve
- You can view upcoming reviews in the **Statistics Dashboard**

## Searching and Filtering

Incrementum provides powerful search capabilities:

### Basic Search

1. Open the search panel via **View > Show Search Panel** or click **Tools > Search**
2. Enter your search terms
3. Select entity types to search (Documents, Extracts, Learning Items)
4. Results will appear in the tabs below

### Advanced Search Syntax

- Use quotes for exact phrases: `"neural networks"`
- Specify fields: `title:introduction author:smith`
- Exclude terms: `python NOT django`
- Use tag filters: `tag:science tag:biology`

### Filtering

Use the filter panels to narrow results by:
- Date ranges
- Priority levels
- Categories
- Tags
- Learning parameters (difficulty, interval, etc.)

## Knowledge Network

The Knowledge Network visualizes connections between your knowledge items:

### Viewing the Network

1. Go to **Tools > Knowledge Network**
2. Select the network type:
   - Document-Extract Network
   - Concept Network
   - Learning Path
3. Apply filters as needed
4. Explore connections by dragging nodes and hovering for details

### Creating Learning Paths

1. In the Knowledge Network view, select "Learning Path"
2. Enter a topic to create a path for
3. The system will generate a structured learning sequence
4. Follow the path for optimal learning progression

## Tags and Organization

Tags and categories help organize your knowledge base:

### Managing Categories

3. Review and confirm the suggested tags

## Backup and Restore

Protect your knowledge base with regular backups:

### Creating Backups

2. Fine-tune spaced repetition parameters
3. Adjust retention targets and interval modifiers

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Learn these shortcuts to speed up your workflow:

- **Ctrl+O**: Import file
- **Ctrl+R**: Start review session
- **Ctrl+F**: Search
- **Ctrl+Tab**: Switch between tabs
- **Ctrl+S**: Save current item

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: The application won't start**
A: Check that you have activated the virtual environment and installed all dependencies.

**Q: PDF documents don't display correctly**
A: Ensure you have installed PyMuPDF correctly and your PDF is not corrupt.

**Q: Learning items aren't appearing in review**
A: Check that items have been created correctly and are due for review.

### Data Recovery

If you encounter database issues:
1. Go to **Tools > Backup & Restore**
2. Restore from the most recent backup
3. If no backup is available, check for the backup created before modifications in your data directory
