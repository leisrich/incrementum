# Statistics View

The Statistics View provides valuable insights into your learning progress and system usage. This document explains the different statistics and charts available, how to interpret them, and how to use them to optimize your learning.

## Overview

The Statistics View visualizes data about your documents, extracts, learning items, and reviews. It helps you understand your learning patterns, track your progress, and identify areas that may need more attention.

## Accessing the Statistics View

You can access the Statistics View through:

- The "Tools â†’ Statistics Dashboard" menu option
- The "Statistics" button in some views (like the Queue View)

## Main Components

The Statistics View is organized into several tabs, each focusing on different aspects of your learning:

### Overview Tab

The Overview tab provides a high-level summary of your system usage and learning progress:

- **Summary Statistics**: Shows counts of documents, extracts, learning items, and reviews
- **Activity Over Time**: Charts your activity patterns across different time periods
- **Learning Progress**: Shows the cumulative growth of items created and items reviewed

### Retention Tab

The Retention tab focuses on how well you're retaining information:

- **Retention Rate**: Shows how well you're remembering items over time
- **Item Difficulty Distribution**: Visualizes the distribution of item difficulties

### Workload Tab

The Workload tab helps you plan your future learning sessions:

- **Review Workload Forecast**: Predicts how many items will be due for review in coming days
- **Item Status Distribution**: Shows the distribution of items across different stages of learning

## Using the Controls

The Statistics View provides several controls to customize your view:

- **Time Range**: Select from preset ranges (Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, Last 90 Days, Last Year, All Time)
- **Category**: Filter statistics to focus on specific categories
- **Refresh**: Update the statistics to reflect the most current data

## Interpreting the Charts

### Activity Chart

The Activity chart shows two metrics over time:
- **Extracts Created**: The number of new extracts you've created each day
- **Reviews Performed**: The number of reviews you've completed each day

This helps you visualize your usage patterns and identify trends in your learning habits.

### Progress Chart

The Progress chart shows the cumulative growth of:
- **Cumulative Items**: Total number of learning items created
- **Items Reviewed**: Total number of items reviewed at least once

This helps you track the overall growth of your knowledge base and review coverage.

### Retention Chart

The Retention chart shows your retention rate over time, which is the percentage of reviews where you rated an item as "Good" or better. Higher percentages indicate better knowledge retention.

### Difficulty Distribution Chart

This chart shows how many items fall into each difficulty category:
- Very Easy (0.0-0.2)
- Easy (0.2-0.4)
- Medium (0.4-0.6)
- Hard (0.6-0.8)
- Very Hard (0.8-1.0)

This helps you understand the difficulty profile of your learning items.

### Workload Forecast Chart

The Workload Forecast chart predicts how many items will be due for review each day over the next 30 days, helping you plan your study sessions.

### Interval Distribution Chart

This chart shows the distribution of items across different interval lengths:
- New (0-1 day)
- 1-7 days
- 1-4 weeks
- 1-3 months
- 3-12 months
- >1 year

This helps you understand how your knowledge is distributed across different stages of learning.

## Tips for Using Statistics

- **Review regularly**: Check your statistics weekly to identify patterns in your learning
- **Look for trends**: Rising or falling retention rates may indicate changes in your learning effectiveness
- **Plan ahead**: Use the workload forecast to schedule study time when you'll have more items due
- **Balance your efforts**: If certain categories have lower retention rates, consider focusing more on those areas
- **Track your progress**: Use the cumulative charts to stay motivated by seeing your progress over time

## Technical Notes

The statistics data is calculated from your database and reflects your actual usage of the system. While most calculations are straightforward, a few points to keep in mind:

- **Retention rate** is calculated as the percentage of items rated 3 or higher during reviews
- **Difficulty** is determined by a combination of your ratings and the algorithm's assessment
- **Workload forecast** is based on currently scheduled review dates, which may change as you perform reviews

## Compact Statistics View

In some parts of the application, you'll see a compact version of the statistics that shows only essential metrics:
- Documents count
- Extracts count
- Items count
- Due items count

This provides a quick overview without taking up much screen space.
